= Building from source

Building from source is fairly straightforward if you have the rust toolchain installed, our CI chain tests against the latest stable version at the time the checks are run.
If you need to install this, generally the recommended way is to use https://rustup.rs/[rustup].

After rust is installed simply run

    cargo build

To create the binary file in _target/debug_.

== Build dependencies
The agent depends on native systemd libraries to communicate with systemd.
For the build process to work these need to be installed on the build system.
